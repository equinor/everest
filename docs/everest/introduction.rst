Background and motivation
=========================

Everest is a tool, which uses ensembles of models to deliver a robust optimization.

While the result of an data assimilation process is an ensemble of models, the result of the robust optimization process is one optimal strategy, for example for well order or drainage strategy. With this optimised strategy we can, e.g., maximize net present value (NPV) with respect to the geological uncertainty in the models. Note that Everest is a generic tool that can be applied to other optimisation problems (also outside the domain of Oil & Gas).

The objectives (what to optimise) can, for example, be the Net Present Value (NPV), the recovery factor, or carbon emissions. The controls (what to adjust in order to optimise the objective) can, for example, be the drilling order of the wells and production and/or injection rates (drainage strategy). Additionally, constraints on these controls can be handled both within Everest and/or in flow simulator.

The primary goal of the Everest tool is to find an "optimal" strategies by utilizing an ensemble of reservoir models (e.g., an ensemble of geologically-consistent models). This will help make robust decisions about drilling schedule or drainage strategy in an efficient and assisted manner.

To this end, an optimization problem is formulated and solved by the *Ensemble Optimization* (EnOpt) method described here: :ref:`en-opt-label`.

A single configuration file is required to define controls, constraints, objective functions, and other items related to gradient estimation for optimization. This file should also include items related to simulations themselves, such as manipulating schedule files according to the controls and calculating the values of objective functions and constraints.

Everest will, then, generate new set of controls as a result of the simulated results, e.g., ensemble objective function values.
The flow chart below provides a detailed description of the elements involved in running an optimization experiment.


Considerations regarding the usage of Everest
-----------------------------------------------

Everest can assist the decision makers when there are many outcomes or decisions that need to be made. If the decision and outcome is limited or easy, then Everest may not be needed as one can evaluate the outcomes with a heuristic approach. However, it is unlikely that one can easily find few outcomes or real optimised, robust strategies using this “manual” approach when uncertainty is involved. In the following sections we will discuss the use of Everest in different cases and some of the "ifs and buts " associated with the application of the tool.

The power of the Everest tool is to assist in optimising strategies while capturing the underlying reservoir uncertainty, which is modelled by an ensemble of models. A crucial factor for the success of the optimisation is to have good enough model quality and the uncertainty well represented - i.e., to span the current understanding or knowledge of the reservoir uncertainty. Moreover, the greater the reservoir complexity, the more important it is to have many model realisations in the ensemble, i.e., to span the actual reservoir uncertainty. The alternative might lead to a situation where the strategy is not representative. The essential take away is that Everest cannot improve your model's quality and your uncertainty representation, and that the quality of the Everest optimisation results is dependent on the quality of the underlying model and uncertainty representation.

When doing experiments that involve tuning specific parameters, it is advisable to begin with a coarse-grained approach when adjusting control variables. Initially, one might consider modifying the parameters at long intervals, such as every several years or at key points in the process timeline. This sets a foundational structure for the optimization without overwhelming the algorithm with too many variables.

In general, the following elements should be reflected upon when consider applying Everest for decision support and decision making:

* the need for, or value of, robustness of optimisation results;

* the value of time saving from using the tool (heuristic approach versus assisted optimisation);

* the quality of the underlying reservoir models and uncertainty span;

* the need for a tool in order to handle reservoir complexity or uncertainty in decision making.


Everest workflow

The figure shows the Everest workflow. The workflow starts with defining the initial controls (e.g., drilling order), objective function (e.g., NPV), constraints (e.g., upper injection rate) and related information, such as optimization algorithm, perturbation magnitude, and ensemble realizations used in optimization. Based on these information, Everest will run simulations in order to evaluate either objective function or gradient with respect to the current control variables. Also, it prepares the input files for the simulator, such as the schedule file.

Normally, different schedule files will be generated for different control values. For example, in case the drilling order is the control, with different drilling orders the well open dates can be totally different, which leads to different schedule files. Once all necessary simulator files are set up, the ensemble of simulations will be run. Based on the simulation results, Everest will calculate the objective function value (e.g. NPV) or constraint values. Everest will then update the controls based on the selected optimization algorithm and run a new experiment until the convergence criteria is satisfied.
