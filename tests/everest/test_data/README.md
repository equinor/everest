This folder contains configuration files and data used by the tests in Everest.

Some optimization cases have been run in advance and the resulting data has been included here in order to make the tests faster.
In particular:
- folders called `cached_results_XXX` typically a `seba.db` file that was generated running case `XXX.yml`. The naming convention is not always very strict, but it should be  obvious what configuration file was used to generate the cached results.
- folders called `something_something_output` are copies of the output folders (possibly stripped down) created when running a certain case. The name of the folder matches the entry `environment/output_folder` given in the config file. And usually the `something_something` part of the name makes it clear what config file this output refers to.

For example, in the `mocked_test_case` folder we have:
- a `cached_results_multi_objectives` folder which contains a `seba.db` file generated by running Everest on `mocked_test_case/config_multi_objectives.yml`. It is used by the `TestMultiobjectives` test case
- a `mocked_multi_batch_output` folder which is a cleaned copy of the output folder generated by running Everest on `mocked_test_case/mocked_multi_batch.yml`.

If Everest is modified in a way that would affect the outcome of running test cases, please make sure that the pre-computed results are updated accordingly.
